# FS22 Worker Takeover Mod

Seamlessly take control of the vehicle when dismissing an AI worker. 

Enter the vehicle and dismiss the AI worker: the cruise control will remain activated and the implements will stay lowered and turned on, as applicable.

Without this mod, when the player dismisses an AI worker, the cruise control is deactivated and the active implements are automatically lifted and/or turned off.
